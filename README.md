# NeoPixels Parking Sensor
Using NeoPixels and an Ultrasonic Sensor as a parking aid

Parking sensor using a neopixel led ring and distance sensor (HC-SR04).
Configure the digital pins used for distance sensor and neopixels below.
   
Advice! In general to feed leds and distance sensor serparatly from your Arduino.
My Nano did survive the test - does not use too much juice... You can also adjust intesity of the LEDs to reduce the power requirements.
